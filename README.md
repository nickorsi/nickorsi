# 👋 Hello! I'm Nick Orsi 💻 Software Engineer & Former Civil Engineer 🏗️

For 8 years of my life I worked as a Civil Engineer accross 3 different states building really cool projects. A few examples include widening the 101 Freeway in San Mateo, CA and raising the Gross Reservoir Dam in Denver, CO. After a successful 8 years in the industry, I decided to transition my career to return to a life long passion held for tech.
