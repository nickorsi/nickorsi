## üëã Hello! I'm Nick Orsi üíª Software Engineer & Former Civil Engineer üèóÔ∏è

For 8 years of my life I worked as a Civil Engineer across 3 different states helping build really cool projects. I mangaged a lot of interesting work (including blasting üí•), worked with talented teams, and helped make positive impacts. I have since transitioned my career to return to a life long passion held for tech. After completing an intense 17 week program with [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/), I'm excited to combine my technical knowledge with the habits and skillset of a practicing engineer to work as a software engineer. I look forward to continue working on challenging projects, with talented teams, making positive impacts.
